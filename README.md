### 📝 Description
Contains a collection of my starter-level SQL/mySQL exercise solutions from week 8 (workbook 7). <br>
The workbook (PDF) containing most of the exercises from the week cannot be uploaded due to Pluralsight ownership rights. The same is true for the database (Northwind Traders) referenced. <br>

#### *Topics covered include:*<br> 
- Databases Intro, Defining The Following:
  - Relational Databases
  - DBMS
  - SQL
- mySQL Workbench Basics
- SQL / mySQL Statements (or CRUD Operations: Create Read Update Delete):
  - Querying Data: SELECT, WHERE, COUNT/SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX, GROUP BY
  - JOIN keyword and types of joins
  - Create Data: CREATE keyword for tables (syntax of these statements), INSERT INTO
  - Modify Data: UPDATE
  - Delete Data: DELETE, DROP

### 💭 My Thoughts
You'll notice that the repository structure of this week is different than those of the others for previous weeks/workbooks. That's because (hence the difference in the Tools Used section of this README) it was completed in SQL via MySQL Workbench and Windows CMD for sending changes to this repo. Each folder, with the exception of (Exercise1Responses-NorthwindTraders.txt) all contain .SQL files. This, much like Workshop 7 ([Files Here](https://github.com/gitraspigner/workshops/tree/master/workshop-7)) ([Writeup Here](https://github.com/gitraspigner/workshops?tab=readme-ov-file#week-8---workshop-7)) gave me more familiarity working with the MySQL workbench interface, the structure and capabilities of SQL statements, and a higher level of comfortability using Git from the command line (as opposed to a user-friendly option for VCS inside of an IDE like IntelliJ). I wish I could list more challenges I ran into regarding completing these exercises or even tooling, but there were few. I guess a few challenges while working would include running into some issues with creating new folders/directories and having them be reflected on the repository. The solution to that was a matter of performing some research and remaking the directory and answer file locally, then pushing the changes to the repository. At another point, Github's servers went down for a few hours, but this wasn't a problem since I had been pushing and pulling my changes regularly (and happened to be working locally, saving my files to my hard drive, so it didn't really impact my ability to work on the exercises). I would say an area of improvement for me would be to practice writing more statements in SQL. At the moment, thinking about how I would form certain statements sometimes results in hazy ideas coming to mind (meaning I'm not as quick as I'd like, and sometimes think of something that is very close to the right answer, but not syntactically correct) which is followed by Googling (or ChatGPTing) what the correct statement is. So it would be useful to get more practice with these. Also, on a very positive note, learning about the differences between the different types of JOIN statements went much smoother than when I was initially introduced to them in college years ago. Additionally, we didn't spend that much time on the different types of keys, but I have a good idea of these (so far, in my oh-so-humble opinion) and I know we'll have more practice and tests in SQL in the coming weeks, so we're bound to become more familiar with those and other parts of the language. In any case, it won't stop me from practicing and refreshing my knowledge of SQL on my own. Overall, a very entertaining week/workbook(/workshop) and a cool break from most of the Java-based work we've been doing.

I wrote this README.md, but I did indeed use ChatGPT to give my initial framework and to learn markdown formatting. Therefore here is an APA Style Citation for it:  <br>
